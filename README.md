# Exercises
Exercises done by me.

1. How to run.
Main class in package e3resources_basic_part_1 is 'Exercise' where we can find the main function.
Each class have an main function named as 'exercise()'.
In class 'Exercise' we need to create object of needed class and run function exercise() for this object.
